          <p>
            While more than 95% of racehorses experience exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH), commonly known as bleeders, you want to avoid exposing them to side effects like dehydration from potent drugs. TTL's BleederShield can help strengthen capillaries in the lungs, reduce oxidative stress, and improve blood flow.
